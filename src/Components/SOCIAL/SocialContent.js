                  <p>
                  We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all influencer. It is always more beneficial (from both a cost and an influence perspective) to leverage ten 1,000 follower profiles than a single 10,000 follower profile. Why? Because spreading your brand across multiple influencers allows you to reach more targeted audiences that are more engaged and susceptible to a purchase. 
                  </p>
                  <p> We combine this multi-tier approach to influencers with our data team to capture personalized market research that powers our creatives. Our in-house designers, copywriters, and campaign strategists create eye-catching assets with an emotion-driven narrative to spread across our international influencer network.
